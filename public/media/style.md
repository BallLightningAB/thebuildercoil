## Style to be used to generate coherent images for The Builder Coil

Style: Abstract tech-blueprint / HUD poster style: lots of thin drafting lines, grids, nodes, and floating UI panels.
Warm off-white paper background with subtle grain/blueprint marks and plenty of negative space.
A top-to-bottom gradient from near-black/teal to bright cyan/aqua.
Accents are sparse in cyan and one strong warm orange circle.
Overall feel: clean, geometric, modern “data/architecture diagram” with a slightly printed, textured finish.
