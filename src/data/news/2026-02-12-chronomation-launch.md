# Chronomation.com Is Live

[Chronomation](https://chronomation.com) has a home. The marketing site is live — the first public face of a module-based productivity platform being built for solo-entrepreneurs and small teams.

## The Problem Chronomation Solves

Solo-entrepreneurs wear too many hats. You started a business to do what you're good at — not to spend hours juggling scheduling tools, content pipelines, email campaigns, social posting, and a dozen browser tabs. The tools exist, but they're scattered, expensive, and never quite talk to each other.

Every hour spent on operations is an hour not spent on your craft. For a solo-entrepreneur, that's not just inefficiency — it's the difference between growth and burnout.

## The Vision

Chronomation is being built as a single platform where every module — scheduling, content, email, social, files, analytics, AI workflows — lives under one roof, speaks the same language, and works together by default.

Not another all-in-one that does everything poorly. A carefully-crafted set of modules that each do one thing well, and compose into something greater than the sum of their parts. Composable, AI-native from the core, and focused entirely on people who wear every hat.

## What's on the Site

The site launched as a single-page Manifesto — introducing the brand, the problem, the vision, and the approach. It includes:

- **The problem** — why scattered tools fail solo-entrepreneurs
- **The vision** — a unified, module-based platform for people who do everything themselves
- **A dashboard preview** — a glimpse of the unified interface being designed
- **The approach** — composable modules, AI-native architecture, no enterprise bloat
- **The builder** — who's behind this and why it's being built in the open

The site runs on TanStack Start with React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, and motion/react for scroll-driven animations. Dark-mode only, following the shared [Ball Lightning AB brand system](https://github.com/BallLightningAB/brand-system).

## Building in Public

Every decision, every experiment, every lesson learned in building Chronomation is documented here on [The Builder Coil](https://thebuildercoil.com). It's real progress, shared as it happens.

The [agent-skills-updater](/news/agent-skills-updater-first-release), released earlier this week, is the first open-source tool in the Chronomation ecosystem. The marketing site is the second public milestone. More will follow.

## What's Next

The full platform is in active development. Near-term priorities:

- Rebuilding the company site for [Ball Lightning AB](https://balllightningab.com)
- Integrating agent-skills-updater into the Chronomation tooling layer
- Building the content engine that will eventually power The Builder Coil itself
- Expanding the site as the platform takes shape
