# The Builder Coil is Live

Welcome to **The Builder Coil** – my builder's grimoire where I share what I’m building at Ball Lightning AB, including [Chronomation](/blog/chronomation-architecture-decisions), client work and experiments. I'm excited to finally say that the site is live. 🎉 

## What Is The Builder Coil?

The Builder Coil is more than just a blog. It's a living record of:

- **Building in public** – real progress updates on projects like Chronomation  
- **Agentic experiments** – testing AI-assisted development workflows  
- **Engineering decisions** – the reasoning behind technical choices  
- **Lessons learned** – what works, what doesn’t, and why.

If you're interested in how modern products are actually built – with all the trade-offs, experiments, and occasional dead ends – this is where I’ll share that journey.

## What’s Included at Launch

The initial version of The Builder Coil includes:

### Blog

A fully featured blog with:

- Dark and light mode  
- (95%) Mobile-responsive layout  
- (not yet optimized) SEO-friendly pages
- Tag-based organization for posts  

### Newsletter – *The Upkeep*

You can subscribe to **The Upkeep** to get new posts and progress updates straight to your inbox. The signup uses a GDPR-compliant double opt-in flow.
I expect the newsletter to get up and running in the next few weeks. For now sign-up to not miss out.

### About & Contact

There’s an **About** section where you can read more about Ball Lightning AB and the projects I’m working on, plus a **contact form** (to be enabled on Monday) if you want to get in touch about collaborations or client work. In the mean time, please simply email me=)

## Under the Hood

For those who like to peek behind the curtain, the site currently runs on:

- **Framework:** [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) – see also [Building with TanStack Start: First Impressions](/blog/building-with-tanstack-start)  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui with a combination of premade, customized and tailored blocks/components
- **Content:** Local JSON in Phase 1, moving to Chronomation API in Phase 2 – see also [Chronomation: Key Architecture Decisions](/blog/chronomation-architecture-decisions)  
- **Email:** [Resend](https://resend.com) for transactional and newsletter emails  

## Why “The Builder Coil”?

The name comes from the intersection of engineering and magic – the coil as both an electrical component and a metaphor for the iterative, spiraling nature of software development. Each turn of the coil builds on the last, storing potential and then releasing this channeled knowledge and creativity as something new.

That’s the spirit I want this devlog to capture.

## What’s Coming Next

Over the coming weeks and months, I’ll be publishing posts on topics like:

1. **Chronomation** – the multi-tenant automation and content engine that is my principal product to be, that will also power this site  
2. **TanStack Start in production** – experience reports, patterns, and gotchas  
3. **AI-assisted development** – how I’m using agentic workflows in my day-to-day work
4. **Recent work** - This year's more impactful projects will be covered to a varying degree depending on relevance and rights

On the product side, **Phase 2** of The Builder Coil will be tightly integrated with Chronomation, enabling:

- Dynamic content served directly from the Chronomation API  
- Automated post generation and changelog-to-blog workflows  
- Smarter social sharing and cross-posting

Thanks for being here at the beginning.  
Let’s build something great together. 🌀
