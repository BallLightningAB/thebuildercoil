  "body": "# Building with TanStack Start: First Impressions\n\nWhen we started building The Builder Coil, we had a choice to make: Next.js, Remix, Astro, or something newer. We chose **TanStack Start** – and here's why.\n\n## Why TanStack Start?\n\n### Type-Safe Routing\n\nTanStack Router provides fully type-safe routing out of the box. Every link, every parameter, every loader – all typed. No more runtime errors from typos in route paths.\n\n```typescript\n// This won't compile if the route doesn't exist\n<Link to=\"/blog/$slug\" params={{ slug: post.slug }}>\n  {post.title}\n</Link>\n```\n\n### File-Based with Flexibility\n\nLike Next.js, TanStack Start uses file-based routing. But it also gives you the flexibility to define routes programmatically when needed.\n\n### Server Functions\n\nServer functions in TanStack Start feel natural. They're just async functions that run on the server, with full access to Node.js APIs.\n\n```typescript\nexport const serverFn = createServerFn()\n  .validator(z.object({ email: z.string().email() }))\n  .handler(async ({ data }) => {\n    // This runs on the server\n    await sendEmail(data.email);\n    return { success: true };\n  });\n```\n\n## The Learning Curve\n\nHonestly, the documentation is still catching up with the features. We spent time reading source code and examples. But the Discord community is helpful, and the patterns make sense once you understand them.\n\n## What's Next\n\nWe'll be sharing more about our TanStack Start setup in future posts, including:\n\n- SEO and meta tag management\n- Server-side data loading patterns\n- Integration with shadcn/ui components\n\nStay tuned! 🚀",
