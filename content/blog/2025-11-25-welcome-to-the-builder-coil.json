  "body": "Welcome to **The Builder Coil** – a builder's grimoire for modern development. This is where I document the journey of building software, experiments with agentic AI workflows, and lessons learned running Ball Lightning AB.\n\n## What Is This?\n\nThe Builder Coil is more than just a blog. It's a living record of:\n\n- **Building in public**: Real progress updates on projects like Chronomation\n- **Agentic experiments**: Testing AI-assisted development workflows\n- **Engineering decisions**: The reasoning behind technical choices\n- **Lessons learned**: What works, what doesn't, and why\n\n## Why \"The Builder Coil\"?\n\nThe name comes from the intersection of engineering and magic – the coil as both an electrical component and a metaphor for the iterative, spiraling nature of software development. Each turn of the coil builds on the last.\n\n## What's Coming\n\nIn the coming weeks, expect posts about:\n\n1. **Chronomation** – Our multi-tenant content engine that powers this very site\n2. **TanStack Start** – Our experience building with this modern React meta-framework\n3. **AI Development** – How we're using AI tools in our daily workflow\n\n## Stay Updated\n\nSubscribe to **The Upkeep**, our newsletter, to get updates delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nLet's build something great together. 🌀",
