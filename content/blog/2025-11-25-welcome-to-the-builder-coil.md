Welcome to **[The Builder Coil](/news/the-builder-coil-is-live)** – a builder's grimoire for modern development. This is where I document the journey of building software, experiments with agentic AI workflows, and lessons learned running Ball Lightning AB.

## What Is This?

The Builder Coil is more than just a blog. It's a living record of:

- **Building in public**: Real progress updates on projects like Chronomation
- **Agentic experiments**: Testing AI-assisted development workflows
- **Engineering decisions**: The reasoning behind technical choices
- **Lessons learned**: What works, what doesn't, and why

## Why "The Builder Coil"?

The name comes from the intersection of engineering and magic – the coil as both an electrical component and a metaphor for the iterative, spiraling nature of software development. Each turn of the coil builds on the last.

## What's Coming

In the coming weeks, expect posts about:

1. **Chronomation** – our multi-tenant content engine that powers this very site. See: [Chronomation: Key Architecture Decisions](/blog/chronomation-architecture-decisions)
2. **TanStack Start** – our experience building with this modern React meta-framework. See: [Building with TanStack Start: First Impressions](/blog/building-with-tanstack-start)
3. **AI Development** – how we're using AI tools in our daily workflow
