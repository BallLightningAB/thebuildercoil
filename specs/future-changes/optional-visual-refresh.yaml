    checklist:
      - "Before implementing, confirm the consuming repo uses the same token names and can map to the semantic tokens."
      - "Before implementing, confirm the background pattern CSS is applied in the correct layout/root element."
      - "Before implementing, confirm the hero/news layouts exist in the current pages and can be adjusted without IA changes."
      - "Before implementing, confirm component library (Shadcn) variants match the guidelines, or record deltas."

        - "Apply shared background pattern (see references.shared_design_system.sections.backgrounds_pattern)"

        - "Implement blog/news card pattern on the canonical feed surface (see references.shared_design_system.sections.layout_patterns)"

  goals:
    - "Keep all existing content and information architecture."
    - "Move to a single dark-first 'arcane terminal' theme shared across brands."
    - "Differentiate brands via accent gradients and animations mainly."
    - "Integrate grid/carbon pattern + gradient background, including animated hover states."

  global_theme:
    concept: >-
      Arcane terminal / builder’s grimoire. Calm dark developer UI that feels
      like a spellbook rendered as a modern code editor.
    dark_only_initial: true
    later_light_mode: true
    shared_foundation:
      background:
        ref: "shared-design-system.yaml#brand_system.design.shared.backgrounds.pattern"
      pattern_hover_behavior: >-
        On key cards/buttons, use a slightly stronger, animated variant of the
        grid/carbon pattern: animate background-position slowly and slightly
        increase opacity on hover.

      #6. How to use this
      notes:
        - "Alt aesthetic landing page: set font-family to big_shoulders_500 globally and swap to headings_big_shoulders for titles."
        - "Keep headings mostly uppercase when using Big Shoulders; use the negative tracking there to get that tight, bold look from the deck."
        - "For long-form posts on TBC, you can use the longform_alt body style to get slightly smaller size but keep the same scale and hierarchy."

    per_brand_implementation:
      tbc:
        changes:
          - "Ensure 'Latest from the Coil' cards use updated card hover + gradient."
          - "Apply global gradient+grid background to entire site."

  constraints:
    - "Do not change any textual content, copy, or page routing."
    - "Keep TanStack Start, Shadcn, and existing component architecture; avoid major rewrites."
    - "All work is visual and structural within existing pages: backgrounds, patterns, gradients, components, and hero/news layouts."
