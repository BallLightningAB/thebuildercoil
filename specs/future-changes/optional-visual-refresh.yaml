visual_refresh_spec:
  name: "Visual Refresh – TBC / Chronomation / Ball Lightning"
  audience: "Hubert (LLM dev)"
  scope: "Visual and layout refresh only. No content, routing, or IA changes."

  goals:
    - "Keep all existing content and information architecture."
    - "Move to a single dark-first 'arcane terminal' theme shared across brands."
    - "Use JetBrains Mono for all typography."
    - "Differentiate brands via accent gradients and animations, not different layouts."
    - "Integrate grid/carbon pattern + gradient background, including animated hover states."

  global_theme:
    concept: >-
      Arcane terminal / builder’s grimoire. Calm dark developer UI that feels
      like a spellbook rendered as a modern code editor.

      background:
        base: "#05070A"
        elevated: "#0A1014"
        pattern_description: >-
          Radial gradient from top with subtle violet/teal tint plus grid/carbon
          overlay. Same pattern family reused on heroes, tiles and hover states.

            );
          background-blend-mode: soft-light, normal, normal;
      pattern_hover_behavior: >-
        On key cards/buttons, use a slightly stronger, animated variant of the
        grid/carbon pattern: animate background-position slowly and slightly
        increase opacity on hover.

  layout_patterns:
    hero:
      description: >-
        Two-column hero inspired by factory.ai. Left column content, right
        column animated brand tile. Same pattern used across all three brands.
      desktop_grid: "grid-cols-[minmax(0,1.1fr)_minmax(0,0.9fr)] gap-10-12"
      mobile_behavior: "Stack columns; text first, tile second."
      left_column:
        contents:
          - "Kicker pill (e.g. 'Building in public')."
          - "H1 and optional supporting subheadline."
          - "Short paragraph."
          - "Two CTAs: primary (filled gradient), secondary (outlined/ghost)."
      right_column:
        tile:
          base_style:
            background: "brand_gradient"
            pattern: "same grid/carbon pattern, slightly stronger than page bg"
            radius: "rounded-3xl"
            shadow: "0 20px 60px rgba(0,0,0,0.9)"
          animation_ideas:
            - "Looping CSS gradient shift within the tile."
            - "Simple SVG line/shape animation in brand accents."
          hover_behavior:
            - "Subtle increase in glow and contrast of gradient."
            - "Slow movement of grid pattern (background-position animation)."

    blog_news_block:
      description: >-
        Blog/news sections mimic factory.ai/news: clean card grid with subtle
        borders, pattern on hover, and brand-colored interactions.
      structure:
        header:
          elements:
            - "Section title (e.g. 'Latest from the Coil')."
            - "Right-aligned 'View all posts' link."
        grid:
          columns: "2–3 responsive columns depending on viewport."

          border: "border-image using brand_gradient"
          pattern: "grid/carbon overlay slightly stronger and moving"
          title_effect: "underline in brand accent color"
        content_elements:
          - "Tag pills with brand accent background."
          - "Post title."

          shadow: "soft glow matching gradient"
        hover:

            - "Add low-opacity animated grid overlay."

        hover:

  component_guidelines:
    theme_tokens:
      notes: >-
        Existing YAML token files stay as the single source of truth, but ensure
        Chronomation primaries are teal+pink again (remove teal+blue). Each
        brand should have a small set of semantic tokens:
      semantic_tokens:
        - "--brand-accent-1"
        - "--brand-accent-2"
        - "--brand-gradient"
        - "--brand-tag-bg"
        - "--brand-tag-text"
      mapping: >-
        For each site, set these tokens at the layout root via CSS variables and
        wire them into Tailwind/Shadcn theme config.

    shadcn_components:
      shared_changes:
        button:
          variants:

        card:
          style: "Dark panel with subtle border and pattern-hover behavior."
        badge_tag:

        navbar:
          active_state: "Underline in brand gradient; text in brand accent."
          hover_state: "Accent underline plus color shift."

          - "Apply global gradient+grid background to entire site."
      chronomation:
        changes:
          - "Reapply teal+pink brand palette to hero, CTAs, tags, and nav."
          - "Use same hero and news grid layout as TBC."
          - "Confirm Shadcn theme reads Chronomation-specific tokens, not teal+blue."
      ball_lightning:
        changes:
          - "Use same background and pattern as other brands."
          - "Update hero and highlights to use molten red/orange gradient."
          - "Maintain identical UI language so it reads as parent brand."

  constraints:
    - "Do not change any textual content, copy, or page routing."
    - "Keep TanStack Start, Shadcn, and existing component architecture; avoid major rewrites."
    - "All work is visual and structural within existing pages: backgrounds, patterns, gradients, components, and hero/news layouts."
