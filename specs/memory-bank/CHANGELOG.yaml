    details: |-
      - Ensure blog and news detail hero images use object-contain so logos
        (for example the welcome-to-the-builder-coil hero) are never cropped.
      - Update BlogPostCard thumbnails (home "Latest from the Coil" and the
        blog index) to center hero art inside a 16:9 frame with object-contain,
        preventing top/bottom cropping while retaining a subtle hover scale.
      - Fix Kibo CodeBlock duplicate React key warnings by generating unique
        snippet filenames for fenced code blocks when no explicit filename is
        provided.
      - Wire the Kibo UI ThemeSwitcher component into the header by adapting it
        to the existing ThemeProvider/useTheme context (dark/light/system) and
        replacing the previous generic icon button.
      - Refine the home hero animation so the GitHub contribution graph
        consistently slides in from the right with a blur-to-sharp transition,
        without being double-wrapped by AnimatedGroup, while preserving the
        staggered fade-in for the left hero copy.
      - Document the { post, html, codeBlocks } content contract in
        specs/memory-bank/thebuildercoil-pdd.yaml so Chronomation Phase 2 can
        mirror the current JSON-based behavior.
      - Mark foundation task 1.4 ("Install Kibo UI theme-switcher component")
        as done and keep the Phase 1 implementation plan aligned with reality.
      - Reorder specs/memory-bank/CHANGELOG.yaml entries into reverse
        chronological order (latest version first) without changing the content
        of the existing entries.
