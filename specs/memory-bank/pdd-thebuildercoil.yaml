          post_response_shape: |
            TBCsite expects Chronomation public APIs to return, per post:
            - post: metadata + raw body fields matching src/lib/content/types.ts:Post
            - html: server-rendered HTML string for body_markdown/body
            - codeBlocks: array of structured code blocks ({ language, filename, code })
          notes: |
            Phase 1 (local JSON) already uses this { post, html, codeBlocks } shape via
            src/lib/content/loader-server.ts and src/lib/content/server.ts. Phase 2 should
            preserve this contract on Chronomation’s HTTP API so the TBCsite frontend can
            swap file reads for fetch() calls without changing its rendering logic.

  product:
    vision: |
      Chronomation is a multi-tenant content engine that turns raw work artifacts
      (commits, notes, emails, etc.) into structured blog posts and social content
      for SMBs, creators, and influencers.

      The Builder Coil (TBC) is the first tenant and public case study: a builder’s
      log for Ball Lightning AB, powered entirely by Chronomation’s API.
    primary_objectives:
      chronomation:
        - Multi-tenant data model: tenants, channels, projects, feed items, posts, social channels.
        - Activity ingestion:
          - GitHub (changelog/commits via Actions)
          - Email (Resend inbound webhooks)
          - Manual notes (admin UI)
        - Narrative generation:
          - Daily or ad-hoc posts per tenant + channel.
          - Retroactive posts from historical activity.
        - Admin UI:
          - Tenant-aware dashboard for projects, feed, posts, social, and settings.
        - Public API:
          - Read-only endpoints for posts and feeds per tenant/channel.
      tbc_site:
        - Frontend that consumes Chronomation’s public API for:
          - blog index and post pages
          - “news” subset
          - mini “about” + contact form (no booking)
        - Later: merch section using same design system.
        - Serve as a boilerplate/blog package for future Chronomation customers.
      ball_lightning_site:
        - Use Chronomation feeds to show latest TBC posts.
        - Own booking and calendar (Cal.com).
        - Be linked from Chronomation.com as the company behind the product.

    secondary_objectives:
      - Make features generic enough for other SMBs/influencers to adopt with minimal customization.
      - Use TBC as the flagship case study and live dogfooding client.
    non_goals_for_now:
      - Full-blown SaaS self-service signup, billing, and plan management.
      - Arbitrary workflow automation beyond content and sharing.
      - Public user accounts/comments.

  personas:
    - id: "tenant_owner_ball_lightning"
      name: "Nicolas – Ball Lightning"
      role: "Tenant owner / admin"
      goals:
        - Plug Ball Lightning’s repos, notes, and email into Chronomation.
        - Use TBCsite as the main builder/devlog surface.
        - Reuse the same content on BALLsite if useful.
    - id: "tenant_owner_smb_creator"
      name: "Future SMB / influencer"
      role: "External Chronomation customer"
      goals:
        - Ship a blog/content hub quickly using a template like TBC.
        - Automate as much of content generation and sharing as possible.
    - id: "public_visitor_tbc"
      role: "Visitor of The Builder Coil"
      goals:
        - Read current builder posts and key milestones.
        - Discover Chronomation and Ball Lightning.
        - Reach out via a simple contact form.

  scope:
    in_scope_mvp:
      chronomation:
        - Multi-tenant schema (tenants, channels, projects, feed, posts, social, settings).
        - Tenant-aware ingestion HTTP APIs:
          - POST /api/tenants/:tenantSlug/ingest/github
          - POST /api/tenants/:tenantSlug/ingest/email
          - POST /api/tenants/:tenantSlug/ingest/manual
        - Tenant-aware daily post generation:
          - POST /api/tenants/:tenantSlug/cron/daily-post
        - Admin UI at chronomation.com:
          - Login via Better Auth.
          - Tenant-scoped dashboard for Ball Lightning (first tenant).
        - Public read APIs:
          - GET /api/public/:tenantSlug/:channelSlug/feed.json
          - GET /api/public/:tenantSlug/:channelSlug/rss.xml
      tbc_site:
        - Frontend-only app that:
          - Calls Chronomation’s public APIs with tenant/channel slugs.
          - Renders blog index, blog post, news index/detail.
          - Renders mini “about” and contact form (Resend).
        - No booking calendar; refer to BALLsite where needed.
    later_phases:
      - Chronomation.com:
        - richer marketing site
        - case study section linking to TBC and BALLsite
      - Merch on TBCsite:
        - merch index/detail/cart (exact implementation TBD)
      - Social auto-posting from Chronomation:
        - X/LinkedIn integration when safe and stable.
      - Multi-tenant billing and tiered features via Polar.

  architecture:
    overview: |
      Chronomation is the core application and backend, deployed on chronomation.com.
      It includes:
      - Public marketing pages.
      - Authenticated admin UI.
      - Multi-tenant ingestion and content APIs.

      The Builder Coil is a separate frontend project (TBCsite) that talks only
      to Chronomation’s HTTP API and renders the Ball Lightning tenant’s blog.
    tenancy_model:
      concepts:
        tenant:
          description: "Customer/org in Chronomation (Ball Lightning as first tenant)."
        channel:
          description: "Content surface for a tenant (e.g. 'tbc-blog', 'ball-site-blog')."
        project:
          description: "Activity source within a tenant (e.g. blightfell-web3-integration repo)."
      scoping_rules:
        - All projects, feed items, posts, social channels, and settings are attached to a tenant.
        - All posts belong to a tenant and a channel.
        - APIs are always tenant-scoped (via :tenantSlug), and often channel-scoped.
    chronomation_frontend_and_backend:
      framework: "TanStack Start"
      usage:
        - Router: TanStack Router for all routing.
        - Loaders/Server Functions: for admin and public API endpoints.
        - SSR where useful for chronomation.com marketing/admin pages.
      main_areas:
        - Marketing:
          - `/` – marketing landing (Chronomation)
          - `/use-cases/the-builder-coil` – case study pointing to TBCsite
          - `/use-cases/ball-lightning` – case study pointing to BALLsite
        - Admin (authenticated):
          - `/app` – overview dashboard for tenant
          - `/app/projects`, `/app/feed`, `/app/posts`, `/app/social`, `/app/settings`
    tbc_site_frontend:
      framework: "TanStack Start or TanStack Router + Vite"
      data_access: "HTTP calls to chronomation.com public APIs only."
      main_surfaces:
        - `/` – blog-focused home for tenant `ball-lightning` channel `tbc-blog`
        - `/blog`, `/blog/:slug`
        - `/news`, `/news/:slug`
        - `/about`
        - `/contact` (form via Resend)
        - later: `/merch`, `/merch/:slug`
    ball_lightning_site:
      note: |
        BALLsite remains its own project. It:
        - embeds Chronomation feeds for recent posts,
        - exposes booking/calendar,
        - is used as canonical link for scheduling from Chronomation and TBC where relevant.

  non_functional_and_operational:
    security:
      multi_tenancy:
        - "All read/write operations must be explicitly scoped by tenantId (server-side) to prevent cross-tenant leakage."
        - "No tenantId should ever come from the client without being checked against the authenticated user’s allowed tenants in admin flows."
      secrets:
        - "All external keys (Resend, social APIs, Polar) only in server env; never exposed to TBCsite."
      webhooks:
        - "Verify Resend webhook signatures + shared secret before processing."
    logging_and_monitoring:
      - "Log all ingestion calls (github/email/manual) with tenantSlug, projectSlug, count-of-items, and timing."
      - "Log all cron executions per tenant, including number of posts generated and any failures."
      - "Introduce a simple 'ingestion status' metric per tenant for display in Chronomation admin."
    rate_limiting:
      public_api:
        - "Rate limit /api/public/:tenantSlug/:channelSlug/feed.json and rss.xml to avoid abuse."
      ingestion_api:
        - "Basic rate limiting per tenant for /ingest endpoints to avoid accidental loops."
    analytics:
      chronomation_site:
        - "Track high-level analytics on chronomation.com (page views, clicks to TBC/BALLsite, contact submissions)."
      tbc_site:
